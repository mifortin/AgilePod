About:
This is my little library that I use when I make
applications for Apple's iPod/iPad/iPhone.

It started off very small a year ago with a single
file, Blit.h.  From there, it has expanded to be
much larger.

----------------------------------------------------
Development:
The interfaces are in a constant flux.  It is best
to build against a specific revision of the library
until all the kinks get worked out.

----------------------------------------------------
Usage:
Copy the files into your project.  Make sure that
you use a C++ or Objective-C++ file to include the
files.

----------------------------------------------------
More Information:
Download doxygen and compile the doxyfile to
generate the documentation on all the objects
that are part of the public interface.
