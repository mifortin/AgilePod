About:
This is my little library that I use when I make
applications for Apple's iPod/iPad/iPhone.

It started off very small a year ago with a single
file, Blit.h.  From there, it has expanded to be
much larger.

----------------------------------------------------
Development:
The code changes a lot.  If you need a piece of
code, replicate it following the license.

In other words, it's meant to be used in a project,
but not remain stable enough to update to the latest
version without breaking any code.

This was done so that the library can quickly move
and adjust to various projects.  For those that want
to follow the library, code changes are normally
easy to incorporate (just tedious).

----------------------------------------------------
Usage:
Copy the files into your project.  Make sure that
you use a C++ or Objective-C++ file to include the
files.

----------------------------------------------------
More Information:
See the github project page.  There I'll start
documenting what each file does.  Or you can
quickly read through the files; there isn't much.
