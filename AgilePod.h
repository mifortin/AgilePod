	AgilePod is a feeble attempt at simplifying development of iOS games.
	
	The design goals revolve around making saving/restoring state very simple.
	To further simplify memory management (use data sources and items will be
	freed and allocated as needed).
	
	Documentation is best browsed by looking at what is exposed within the
	modules.
	
	It is often said it is easier to learn by example.  Below are links
	to code samples:
